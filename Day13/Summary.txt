Today i learned about debugging tips:
- Describe the problem
- Reproduce bugs i.e keep testing your program using differnt values, check if it have bugs or not
- Evaluate each line
- Watch red underlines
- test if your code is running as you want using print function
- use debuggers like pythontutor.com
- Take rest for sometime 
- Ask a friend or someone experienced 
- google the error and search solutions on stackoverflow
- Run often i.e keep testing your code while writing
